  The same-origin policy
      [1] Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) :-
            is a mechanism that allows
            restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another
            domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.
           
      2] CORS defines :- 
            a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine 
            whether it is safe to allow the cross-origin request.
            It allows for more freedom and functionality than purely same-origin requests,
            but is more secure than simply allowing all cross-origin requests.    
      
      3] does the same-origin policy block all cross-origin requests?  
           nope! , embedding Javascript, CSS, and images from origins is always
           allowed, as well as some POST requests (like form submissions). But, 
           for example, making an arbitrary GET request to an HTTP API isn't.
